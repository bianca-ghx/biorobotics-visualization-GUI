## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly GUI for visualizing electronic measurements and force & distance data in biorobotics applications. By integrating various measurement systems and providing a graphical interface, this project aims to facilitate the analysis and characterization of nanomaterial samples and their interactions with human bodies. The GUI is designed to streamline the data visualization process, making it easier for users to interact with and interpret the measurement results.


## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/biorobotics-visualization-GUI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd biorobotics-visualization-GUI
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

## Usage
To use the GUI for visualizing measurements, follow these instructions:

1. Run the Python scripts provided in the repository:
    ```sh
    python MainWindow.py
    ```
2. Use the GUI to interact with the electronic and force & distance measurement systems.


## Acknowledgements
This project was developed by Bianca Ghiorghiu and Raluca Nutu for the Advanced Engineering Project (PAE) at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The Arduino codes were developed by the force & distance team (Maria del Remei Toda Ribes and Ares Lucena González) and modified by us. The AD5940 evaluation board software was obtained from Analog Devices, authored by Neo Xu.
