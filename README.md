## Introduction
The Advanced Engineering Project (PAE) is a compulsory subject from the Bachelor of Telecommunications Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. This biorobotics project, involves characterizing nanomaterial samples and measuring them to sense distance to a human body. The project also includes a setup to measure force and distance and a software GUI to visualize these results.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/biorobotics-visualization-GUI.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd biorobotics-visualization-GUI
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

## Usage
To use the GUI for visualizing measurements, follow these instructions:

1. Run the Python scripts provided in the repository:
    ```sh
    python MainWindow.py
    ```
2. Use the GUI to interact with the electronic and force & distance measurement systems.


## Acknowledgements
This project was developed by Bianca Ghiorghiu and Raluca Nutu for the Advanced Engineering Project (PAE) at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. The Arduino codes were developed by the force & distance team (Maria del Remei Toda Ribes and Ares Lucena González) and modified by us. The AD5940 evaluation board software was obtained from Analog Devices, authored by Neo Xu.
